A web application that helped me gain experience building RESTful APIs and microservices using Spring Boot, implementing features like security, data access, and messaging. For the frontend I used React JS, while for the distributed database I used PostgreSQL. There are two types of users: the administrator who can manage users and devices and the client who can see their own devices and statistics about them. Device consumption is measured via a simulator that transmits data to RabbitMQ, which then forwards it to the communication management microservice. Additionally, all users can access a chat with features like seen and typing indicators in real time. The project was built respecting an architecture with microservices.

Technologies: Spring Boot, React JS, Rabbit MQ, PostgreSQL, Docker, WebSocket, JWT security
